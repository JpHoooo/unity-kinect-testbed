#### Issue

When opening the project, you will find the following bug:

![20210916-bug](https://github.com/JpHoooo/unity-kinect-testbed/blob/master/Recordings/20210916-bug.jpg)

#### Reason

`BackgroundRemovalManager.cs` sets the access permission of the `textureRes` parameter to private, so we cannot call it directly

#### Solution

find the `BackgroundRemovalManager.cs` and modify it like the following code

```diff 
  //render texture resolution
- private Vector2Int textureRes;
+ public Vector2Int textureRes;
```
